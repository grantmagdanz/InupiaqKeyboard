# SnapBoard

This is a iOS keyboard built off of the [Tasty Imitation Keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard). It is a fully functional keyboard that allows a user to add extra lines of text on a Snapchat.

This keyboard is currently optimized for iPhone. iPad should work, but it'll look like a giant iPhone keyboard.

## Fantastic Features

* Auto-capitalization, period shortcut, keyboard clicks.
* An extensible settings screen.
* Dark mode and solid color mode.
* Extra lines on Snapchat!

## Current State

Only the Snapchat funcitonality is working. However, it is on the App Store and can be found [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapboard-multi-line-text/id1035519554?mt=8).

## What's next

* Internationalizing for Arabic and other languages.
* Auto-wrap lines
* Auto-correct

## Build Instructions

1. Go to `Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard` on your device and add the third-party keyboard.
2. Go back to the app. You should be able to select the keyboard via the globe icon.
